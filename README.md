I really liked this one and went with it because it had one line of JS and utilized the HTML range feature.  It reflected very similarly to how I accomplished the same effect in Adobe XD.  I also appreciate the fact that Chris Pennington implemented accessibility right into the code and explains why.
## Workflow
- Started initial documents and folders
Having an initial structure - great foundation to keep organized 
- Filled the images folder with all planned pictures in organized folders
Formatted images to 2 sizes
- Got the boiler plate, head (with all cdns) navigation bar, cdn script, background and footer completed.  
Started with that because it is copied and placed on all the pages.
- First page to have content was the home page.  
- Second page contact page
- Last page my work page
