          <p>I'm a student at Algonquin College of Applied Arts and Technology, on track to graduate
            in April 2024. My college ride has been quite the adventure, exploring a mix of subjects—from web design and
            photography to videography and UX design. But you know what really caught my eye? Motion graphics! During a
            group project in the video production course, I took charge of creating most of the motion graphics used.
            That
            experience got me hyped up for an upcoming dedicated course in that field. Exploring motion graphics got me
            hooked because it's just so fascinating and has a combination of creativity and logic!</p>

          <p>I'm all about soaking up new knowledge—I dive into tutorials across a wide range of topics. My only setback
            is sometimes not fully mastering a specific subject. That's also where my strength lies—I've got a solid
            grasp
            of many topics and an insatiable appetite to learn more. This inherent curiosity keeps me driven to expand
            my
            skill set and venture into uncharted territories. Here's to embracing the joy of learning across the board!

                <p>The third semester I worked on a group project that was documentary style video. We chose to do it on
                  a brewpub and its owner in the Ottawa area called Tooth and Nail. The story is of Matt Tweedy and his
                  discovery of wanting to start the business and some insight into the brewing process he is passionate
                  about. We had six weeks to complete the project among our other classes and their projects. We made it
                  to all weekly meetings with the professor and had all the documentation ready for presentation. At
                  times we were even ahead of schedule. One example is I had some samples of the type of motion graphics
                  and infographic ready to show the professor. He was so encouraged by our work in progress that he
                  slotted us for the first to present to the two Video Production classes combined presentation that one
                  of the program coordinators came to watch some of them. I am very proud of what we produced together.

                <h5>Filming Day</h5>
                <p>My roles in the production of the video span the whole process from the brainstorming to the final
                  edit. The on-set roles I performed were setting up and monitoring the main camera used in the
                  interview and to help set up the lighting. I also helped capture some of the first set of b-roll. Two
                  highlights I have from this part are nailing the creative treatment with the shallow depth of field
                  and catching the LED panel reflecting in the glasses of our stand-in. The creative treatment we were
                  aiming for was a soft background while still having it present in the shot. We also wanted it to have
                  a warm and casual conversational feel with the subjects being interviewed. The subject of our
                  interview also wears glasses. The way I worked around this is placing a reflector at the foot of the
                  light and turning the panel to aim directly at it. This aided the key light which we had set at a
                  higher angle by filling the face from the bottom and front, softening up the shadows. Making sure
                  these were taken care of in-camera made post production that much easier.</p>

            <h5>Motion Graphics</h5>
            <p>My major role was creating the motion graphics and animations which wasn’t initially slated for me to do.
              I created our group’s logo and made the animation for it. The original design was made using vector
              illustrations that translated into After Effects easily. I kept the animation simple and to the point but
              feel like it is impactful. One of the first motion graphics I had in mind when brainstorming was to take
              the existing logos the brewery had already on their cans. The art style used was a vintage, had-drawn look
              to them. To highlight the style, I created what looked like paper cutouts of the different layers I felt
              were there.<br>
              I used Illustrator to do this, since at this point, I didn’t know that you could import Photoshop
              documents and the layers would be treated the same way. Outside of the little bit we had done in class,
              this was the first animation that I made in After Effects. I created a few of these, one of which I also
              took initiative to learn Duik Angela to make. One of the animations was used by a group member to create
              the lower thirds.<br>
              I followed some tutorials to create the map animation and for the inspiration of the timeline infographic.
              I cut the audio from the interview to make it concise and edited it. I synced the animation timing to the
              key moments in the audio clip. The images echo that of the branding already established by the brand. To
              further bring in the branding, I used a bright red for the pins and the markers on the map, as well as the
              bold red line of the timeline that looks like the ones on the top of the can.<br>
              Finally, I did the credits. I modified a template to feel like the bubbles and foam of a golden beer. As a
              team we didn’t see obvious places that my logo animations could work but wanted to make sure they were
              used. At the time of the decision, I only had three created and needed a total of five to match the number
              of us that were on the team. Since we each played a part in so many roles, we opted to not have titles. I
              felt that it was important to include thanks to the establishment, the creator of the logos, the school,
              and the Algonquin peoples on top of those we had interviewed. Unfortunately, our main subject’s father had
              passed away during the postproduction of this piece. We included a tribute to him before the credits roll
              since he was an important figure in our subject’s life.

            <h5>Editing</h5>
            <p>I had the role of final editing. The main tasks I had were color grading the second camera that we used
              and to keyframe all of the cuts made in the audio. Due to the differences in cameras, there was a dramatic
              difference in the white balance between the two. Since the video was already cut and sequenced, I used an
              adjustment layer to quickly apply the same settings over all of the clips. I then went back and tweaked
              the ones that were a little further off. Unfortunately, the room tone we initially took was no longer with
              the project. The main way I got around this was by finding a pause between a question being asked and the
              answer that followed. It wasn’t the ideal situation, but at least there was room tone under all of the
              cuts and the keyframes done. Finally, I added the music. I identified the key moments and made sure to
              place the more emotional break in the music on those parts and blended the ends of the music with the
              next. We limited our video to have two tracks, one was used for the interview and the second was used for
              the animations and the credits. We wanted to make sure there was a energizing rock tune but still
              cinematic to carry along the narrative,</p>

            <h5>Challenges</h5>
            <p>There were some challenges with this project that made for good learning experiences. When working on a
              large project, I like to work as if the timeline is about a quarter less than what is given. I’ve
              experienced unexpected setbacks or interruptions, and by working with the decrease in allotted time
              allowed me to stay on track when that happens. If there is no disruption, it allows for more polishing
              time. Unfortunately, when working in a group not everyone shares this method, and it can be quite
              stressful. One way I managed this was my self-guided learning on After Effects even though I didn’t have
              the footage at the time. I built a template that the timing could be modified based on the audio we got. I
              also worked on other projects that had a similar deadline. The other challenge was limiting the working
              hours on this project. It became a passion project as well as wanting to make something that would pass
              the assignment. The number of hours spent on this is outside the realm of what the original scope of the
              promo video offered to the subject in the video.</p>

            <p>Overall, this project was a great learning experience and has led me to learning a lot more about After
              Effects and motion graphics. </p>

            <p>This is the final project for Web Development III. The focus of the assignment was JavaScript and the use
              of API calls. I chose to do the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) one. When I was looking around at
              libraries I found one called TurnJS that inspired pretty much the whole site. TurnJS turns the website
              content into an interactive book where the pages bend and move like paper. One of the requirements was to
              have favorites stored in local storage, and I thought it would be neat to have it as a photo album. For
              the final turn in, I had to pass up on that idea to accomplish the task at hand. It can be found <a
                href="https://kukk0006.github.io/mtm6302-capstone-Kukk0006/" target="_blank">HERE.</a></p>

            <h3>Assets</h3>

            <p>One of the fonts I chose is Exo as the main font. It is clean and easy to read, but gives a sci-fi feel
              to it. Consolas is the "header" font that has the same feel as Exo but is a little bit blockier.

              I made the books and telescope grow on hover for the desktop, and added a bit of a drop shadow that acts
              like a glow. I have intentions on creating a lottie anima
              All the assets minus the pictures from the APOD site are going to have a cartoon/hand drawn effect. It
              will give a hand crafted, cute/whimsical feel to the site overall.</p>


            <h3>JavaScript</h3>

            <p>JavaScript is something that doesn't come to me naturally. When prompted to write something from scratch,
              I have a tendency to freeze and have difficulty starting. If I am given a foundation of what it needs to
              be, I can typically modify it to do what I need it to do if it is a simple function. On this project,
              there were some major hurdles for me to figure out. The biggest one was getting the book to dynamically
              build based on the number of images in local storage. I sought outside help since the code wasn’t reacting
              the way that I had expected it too. Between their knowledge of other programming languages and my
              understanding of HTML/CSS we did get it working, but at a great time expense and after the due date of the
              project. For the turn-in I opted to turn in one that has a gallery based on a previous assignment for two
              major factors; it wasn’t working fully and to the parameters of the assignment as well as the fact that it
              wasn’t entirely my work. When I continue working on it to get it to the point that I want, the book asset
              will be implemented and credit will be given to the person that helped me.</p>

            <h3>Changes Moving Forward</h3>

            <p>Other than implementing the book as the favorites, I have a few other changes I would like to make to
              finish this as a portfolio piece. First off, I would like to divide the site into multiple pages again.
              When I first developed the project it was four pages, but due to the assignment parameters, it had to have
              one HTML, one CSS and one JS file. I am quite proud of condensing my JS file and getting that one to work
              with no errors. Another thing that I would like to change is the book buttons on the home page. I will
              keep the favorites as a book, but the past pictures are going to change into a tablet, since that makes
              more sense with how the API call works as well as how I designed the page for it. I also want to create
              some animations, likely through Lotties, to bring the whole thing to life and make it more like an
              application than a web site based on my knowledge at this point. Lastly, I want to clean my code up,
              validate my HTML/CSS and add the accessibility that was taught in Web Development II. </p>

              This assignment was an Illustrator exercise in the pen tool, as well as the pathfinder options. The
              task was to take a rasterized image and turn it into vector art. I chose the face of the band Ghost
              since that is one of my favorite artists and it is a dynamic image. The contrast in color with the
              fill light being golden in color versus the cold tones in the rest of the image.
            </p>
            <p>Live trace was off limits, since it was to be done manually. I was able to re-create this image with
              only 13 colors. When testing the live trace options, the image lost a lot of detail when setting the
              limit to 13 colors maximum. To match the colors, I used the eyedropper tool to create my pallet.</p>
            <p>By changing the image in to vector, it allows the image to be resized without loosing detail or
              becoming blurred. 13 colors is a lot of colors for screen printing or heat transfer vinyl, though if
              the end goal was that, the colors could be further reduced. by using the pathfinder tool, it cuts each
              color block into it's own shape and makes it easy to convert it into a stencil. </p>

            <p>I love to explore photoshop so I expanded on the assignment here. The parameters was to cut out two
              subjects and place them on a different background. The movie Rocky Horror Picture Show was my
              inspiration. I found a font that is very similar to the movie title and captured images of two of the
              characters. I used colors present in the film as well.</p>

            <p>I used many tools to create the background and the golden seal. All of the text are modified quotes
              or a play-on-words from the film.</p>

            <p>I wanted to have an elegant but a dark look. I took inspiration for the logo and color pallet from
              wine bottles. The content inspired by historical horror movies. Filled with puns, the text adds a fun
